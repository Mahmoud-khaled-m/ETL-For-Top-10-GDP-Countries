# ETL-For-Top-10-GDP-Countries
This practice project involves creating a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to access and process GDP data from a website. The goal is to extract GDP information for different countries, transform the data into a specified format, and load it into both a CSV file and a database table.
